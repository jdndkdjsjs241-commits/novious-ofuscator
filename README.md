# Novious Lua Obfuscator

Novious is a lightweight, educational Lua obfuscator designed to help developers understand the fundamentals of code transformation, string encoding, and structural obfuscation.  
It is not intended to provide full security, but rather to serve as a learning tool and a basic protection layer for simple Lua scripts.

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

This obfuscator is **for educational purposes only**.  
Obfuscated code **may not work perfectly** across different Lua environments or Roblox executors.  
Always test your scripts before distributing them.

Novious does **not** guarantee security against reverse engineering, deobfuscation tools, or exploit-related use cases.

thanks to those who helped me make this.

## 🔥 Note
This project helped me learn a lot about Lua, code transformation and web development.
It was a fun and meaningful learning experience.
It wont be actively I've kept it up because sometimes I really feel pressure and it stops feeling like a hobby, anyway thanks.
